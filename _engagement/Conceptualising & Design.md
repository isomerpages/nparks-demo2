*Focus group discussion for Pasir Panjang Park*

The community will take part in reimagining the park experience, generating ideas based on their insights. This could be carried out through 1-on-1 interviews, focus group discussions, observations, or on-site interviews. Using these inputs, they will then be guided to put together a design document.

After the preliminary design plan is charted out, the community will help to test out the proposed design on future user groups, and refine the design plan from the feedback gathered.

This process can take up to four months.

*Friends of Marine Park*

We want to build a sense of space and ownership by giving our communities a stronger say in the making of their living environment.

In 2019, the Friends of the Parks Engagement initiative was extended to involve communities to take part in the design, development and management of Singapore’s parks and green spaces. Communities will be invited to co-create more than 50 parks across Singapore over the next five years.

With this extension, the community will be involved starting from the conceptualisation and design phase to the construction phase, as well as to manage the park after its completion. We are also engaging a wider range of stakeholders so that the community can play a larger role in designing and developing parks for fellow Singaporeans. Through these efforts, we aim to co-create parks with meaningful facilities that would cater to the community’s needs and lifestyle.

We aim to provide an enjoyable and inclusive experience to our park visitors by building communities who are active advocates for the responsible use of our green spaces.

The Friends of the Parks is a ground-led initiative to promote stewardship and responsible use of Singapore's parks. 

The initiative is modelled after the successful Friends of Ubin Network (FUN). It was conceived during the SGFuture conversations in January 2016, where participants called for greater community ownership and stewardship of our parks.

The Friends of the Parks initiative consist of localised communities representing active stakeholders and volunteers within the park's ecosystem. Through the formation of the Friends of the Parks community, Friends can play a more active role in promoting active and responsible uses of our Parks through ground-led programmes and initiatives.

We have 12 active Friends of the Parks communities today with over thousands of volunteers who have actively participated in engagement sessions, co-led events and activities and more. These initiatives have helped produce better park designs and provide more recreational opportunities.

You can be our Friend today too: [Click here to join us as a stakeholder for future engagement sessions!](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5e21692b935451001117a12e)

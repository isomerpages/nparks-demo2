The Friends of the Parks is a ground-led initiative to promote stewardship and responsible use of Singapore's parks. The initiative is modelled after the successful Friends of Ubin Network (FUN). It was conceived during the SGFuture conversations in January 2016, where participants called for greater community ownership and stewardship of our parks.

The Friends of the Parks initiative consist of localised communities representing active stakeholders and volunteers within the park's ecosystem. Through the formation of the Friends of the Parks community, Friends can play a more active role in promoting active and responsible uses of our Parks through ground-led programmes and initiatives.

The Friends of Clementi-Ulu Pandan Nature Corridor group was formed in 2021 as part of NParksâ€™ efforts to work with the community to strengthen the ecological resilience along the two new recreational trails at the Clementi Nature Corridor, such as through forest restoration and habitat enhancement works.

This is in line with the vision to transform Singapore into a City in Nature, for which community stewardship is a key thrust.

<p>We aim to provide an enjoyable and inclusive experience to our park visitors
by building communities who are active advocates for the responsible use
of our green spaces.</p>
<p>The Friends of the Parks is a ground-led initiative to promote stewardship
and responsible use of Singapore's parks.</p>

<p>The initiative is modelled after the successful Friends of Ubin Network
(FUN). It was conceived during the SGFuture conversations in January 2016,
where participants called for greater community ownership and stewardship
of our parks.</p>

<p>The Friends of the Parks initiative consist of localised communities representing
active stakeholders and volunteers within the park's ecosystem. Through
the formation of the Friends of the Parks community, Friends can play a
more active role in promoting active and responsible uses of our Parks
through ground-led programmes and initiatives.</p>

<p>We have 14 active Friends of the Parks communities today with over thousands
of volunteers who have actively participated in engagement sessions, co-led
events and activities and more. These initiatives have helped produce better
park designs and provide more recreational opportunities.</p>

The Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, with Bukit Timah Hill as its core, is the centrepiece of our shared natural heritage. It is an ASEAN Heritage Park with the largest surviving primary rainforest in Singapore, a microcosm of our rich biodiversity, and a sanctuary for many of our endemic and threatened plants and animals.

The Friends of Bukit Timah Forest (FoBTP) is a community-led initiative that seeks to promote the conservation, improvement, guardianship and better appreciation of the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the adjacent nature parks around it. These are the Hindhede Nature Park, Dairy Farm Nature Park, Singapore Quarry Wetland, Bukit Batok Nature Park, and the forthcoming Rifle Range Nature Park.
It is open to all individuals, schools and community organisations with an interest in these nature areas â€“ hikers, bikers, joggers, exercise groups, nature lovers, researchers and anybody who cherishes the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and its surrounding nature parks.

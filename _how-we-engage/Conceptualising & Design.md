*Focus group discussion for Pasir Panjang Park*

The community will take part in reimagining the park experience, share their thoughts and needs, and generate ideas based on their insights. 

These are carried out through joint ground obeservations, interviews, focus group discussions and surveys.

Ideas are generated, tested and refined through workshop sessions where participants are engaged in lively conversations, build on each other's ideas and allow their creativity to flow freely.

The wider community will also get to provide their views on these ideas. Based on feedback, ideas are refined before being put together into a design plan.

This process may take between 4 and 6 months.

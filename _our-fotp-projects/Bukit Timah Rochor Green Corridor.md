Envisioned as a journey through a riverine forest, the Bukit Timah-Rochor Green Corridor will be a new linear park along the Bukit Timah Canal that will be part of the 360 km island-wide network of recreational routes that we are currently curating, enabling Singaporeans to explore nature throughout the island while enhancing connectivity between various places of interests, as well as natural and urban landscapes.

The first phase of the project consists of a sky park elevated above the Bukit Timah canal and spans around 1 km, from the Rail Corridor at Rifle Range Road to Jalan Kampong Chantek.

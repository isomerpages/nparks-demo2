**Destination Parks** are large, regional parks with thematic identities and unique feature to attract visitors from all over Singapore. In 2012, Admiralty Park, East Coast Park and Lakeside Garden at Jurong Lake Gardens (formerly known as Jurong Lake Park) were identified for development into Destination Parks, which have since enjoyed high visitorship.
 
##### Proposed enhancements for planned Destination Parks

HortPark will be enhanced as an evolving **gardening and lifestyle hub** equipped with spaces for various communities to come together and bond through shared gardening and horticulture interests. In addition, HortPark will serve as a demonstration site and horticultural showcase for the community to learn about how gardening and horticulture can improve well-being.

The enhanced Labrador Nature Park will be a key node in the Labrador Nature Park Network, with ecological corridors that will link to various biodiversity sites within the network. To enrich visitors' experience of Labrador Nature Park's uniquely intertwined **natural and built heritage**, NParks will study the restoration of the former gun battery at Berlayer Hill, one of the few remaining British military structures at Labrador Nature Park.

The enhanced West Coast Park will be positioned as the western gateway to the Greater Southern Waterfront. Visitors can look forward to different zones that provide a variety of active to passive family-centric experiences.

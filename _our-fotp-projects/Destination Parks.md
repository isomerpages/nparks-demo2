![](/images/dp%20overview.png)
NParks **plans to enhance 13 southern parks** as part of the curation of themed trails to link them up, as well as plans to enhance HortPark, Labrador Nature Park and West Coast Park into **Destination Parks**.

**Destination Parks** are large, regional parks with thematic identities and unique feature to attract visitors from all over Singapore. In 2012, Admiralty Park, East Coast Park and Lakeside Garden at Jurong Lake Gardens (formerly known as Jurong Lake Park) were identified for development into Destination Parks, which have since enjoyed high visitorship.
 
 #### Proposed enhancements for planned Destination Parks

HortPark will be enhanced as an evolving **gardening and lifestyle hub** equipped with spaces for various communities to come together and bond through shared gardening and horticulture interests. In addition, HortPark will serve as a demonstration site and horticultural showcase for the community to learn about how gardening and horticulture can improve well-being.

The enhanced Labrador Nature Park will be a key node in the Labrador Nature Park Network, with ecological corridors that will link to various biodiversity sites within the network. To enrich visitors' experience of Labrador Nature Park's uniquely intertwined **natural and built heritage**, NParks will study the restoration of the former gun battery at Berlayer Hill, one of the few remaining British military structures at Labrador Nature Park.

The enhanced West Coast Park will be positioned as the western gateway to the Greater Southern Waterfront. Visitors can look forward to different zones that provide a variety of active to passive family-centric experiences.

#### Proposed curated Themed Trails

It is planned for each of the 13 parks to have a **nature playgarden** that is unique to their setting. These nature playgarden nodes will be linked together by a trail that will allow children and families to explore the nature playgardens in all the 13 parks.

To highlight coastal, riverine and secondary forest habitats of the southern region, a trail will be curated to allow visitors to discover and experience the sights and sounds of these habitats.

Existing **heritage** sites, as well as those earmarked for restoration, will be weaved into trails that will incorporate coastal, ridgeline and World War II historic elements.

Various existing and proposed **community** spaces within the 13 southern parks, such as therapeutic gardens and event lawns, will be linked up to make them more accessible to residents and neighbouring communities.


NParks will be carrying out public consultation to seek ideas and feedback on the plans to enhance the three planned Destination Parks, which will help shape their designs. Express your interest to take part in our engagement sessions [here](www.go.gov.sg/fotpengagement).

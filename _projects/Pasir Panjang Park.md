Pasir Panjang Park is the first park to benefit from this community engagement initiative. It holds significant natural and maritime heritage that can interest stakeholders to reimagine the park to be a vibrant place for the community, to create new bonds and strengthen existing ones, bring people closer to the Port to discover or rediscover Singaporeâ€™s natural and maritime heritage, or to just have a place to escape the busy city life. 

We invite you to co-create Pasir Panjang Park with us!

Get involved in future programmes and activities such as gardening, designing wayfinding features, contributing to telling the Pasir Panjang Park story, and more!
